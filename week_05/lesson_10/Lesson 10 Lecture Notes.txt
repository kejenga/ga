ARRAYS
Solution for Rock, Paper, Scissors will be up

What is it, why do we need it, what are they for?

Set of data, collection of images - want to store and manipulate them

List of objects - multiple values in one variable
Literal notation []

myArr=['Hello',54.3,true]
You can enter a space which is undefined

Arrays have an index, which start at zero [0]
.length will print the number of elements in the array

CAROUSEL PSEUDO CODE

Instead of hiding/revealing, update the attribute
Array all images
Take position 0 and replace with other values
Two events: back and skip

.length will say how many are in there, can +/-1 value to move through and target each image in each event
