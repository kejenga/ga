Sublime is a text editor, not an IDE (Interactive Development Environment). 
(GitHub has released Atom which is a clone)
- can use notepad, but you have to handcode everything.
- Sublime has syntax highlighter
Power of front end lanuages is that you can see results immediately 

There are six headline tags <h1> - <h6> 
- ranked by importance/weight
- use these semantically
- use them in order so that they make sense

Levels of indentation
- ease of use; can see what is nested where
- use tab to indent; to re-indent, select text and ctrl+[] to shift

<ul> unordered list
<ol> ordered list
<li> list item

Breakdown the opening and closing <ul> onto separate lines, and then indent list

Make sure to close your tags, even though you won't always need to. Needs to be valid according to the W3C standard.

Starting to to talk about hierarchy. If you take out <ul>, we have lost the indentation, plus the semantics of the list. The web browser needs to be able to read what the parent tag. The list item only identifies an item; the parent tag defines the kind of list item.

Boilerplate document is a good starting point for any webpage
<! doctype html> - tells web browser that we're working with valid HTML5
- have to make sure it's at the top - it's a self-closing type 
- starts with a ! 
- no other tags do this
- older browsers will not render the page correctly
There's a different doctype for each HTML type

<html lang="en"> - everything else has to be under this tag </html>
- sometimes tags need additional configuration
- here we have specified an attribute
- in this case the attribute is lang
- so here we set language (lang) to English (en)
- this is an ISO standard and can be looked up to change the language
- helps search engines to know which language the page is in
- have an attribute and a value - the value is delimited by "" - always quote the value of the attribute
- <html> has two required child elements - <head> and <body> and that is the order
- inside <head> we have metadata about website (not onscreen) - can contain <title>, metatags etc.
- computers can understand different character sets - <meta charset="utf-8">
- we can specify the table of characters
- utf-8 has all the standard Latin characters (8/16 - 8-bit/16-bit)
- can include RSS feed info
- inside <body> we hold the content (onscreen)

Some tags close themselves
- if a tag doesn't have any content then it may not need a closing tag
- e.g. a horizontal rule <hr>
- only certain tags are self-closing
- does this tag hold any content?
- self-closing or otherwise, a tag can have an attribute <tag attribute="value">
- a tag can have multiple values <tag att1="value" att2="value">

<code></code> allows us to enter code on a webpage and it will look like code
<a href=""></a> link - href is a required attribute for the anchor
<strong></strong> embolden
<em></em> emphasis

Always close things in the order that they've been opened
- a hyperlink which doesn't have the http:// will try to locate something inside the document
- http:// and https:// are protocols
- so: <a href="cookie.jpg"> will access that image within the same folder that the html file is saved
- this is known as a relative URL

Character entity = creating a specific symbol/character on the page &mdash; &nbsp;
- use the thing that looks best? No use CSS to use the appropriate header

<blockquote> Way of marking up a quotation
- gives semantic meaning to the text
- gives us something to style in CSS
- the browser knows what it is
- also you can have inline quotation
- you can embed <cite> in <blockquote>
- that marks up a citation i.e. -- author

<a href="mailto:email@email"> will force open the email client; by embedding your email address, spambots can scrape the site, so you may get additional spam
