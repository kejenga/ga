How to centre a div
Normalise/reset.css

Can utilise "container" - give it a width
- to centre, apply margin, two values
- zero to top & bottom; ato to either side

Normally background spans and content is centred
- so use a class which can be applied to multiple elements
- added a div with the container class around the text - so the header is full width and the content has been centred

borders weight style color

Complete exercise - background-size: cover;
overflow: hidden;
